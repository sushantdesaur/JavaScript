// Variables

/* 
Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
*/

// let myVariable;

// myVariable = "Bob";

// After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:

// let myVariable = "Bob";
// myVariable = "Steve";

// console.log(myVariable);
