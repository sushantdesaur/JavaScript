// Variables

/* 
Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
*/

// let myVariable;

// myVariable = "Bob";

// After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:

// Traditional JavaScript Variables 

var number = 10
 
// Let Variable

let myVariable = "Bob";
myVariable = "Steve"; // In let value is replaceable

// Const Variable 

const name = "Jane"

let boolean = true

const array = ["Jane", 10, true]

const obj = {
    id: 1,
    movie: "Jack Ryan",
    year: 2018,
    live: true
}

console.table(obj);
