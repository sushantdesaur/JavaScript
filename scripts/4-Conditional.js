// Conditionals

// Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if ... else statement.

let iceCream = "chocolate";
if (iceCream === "chocolate") {
  alert("Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!");
} else {
  alert("Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...");
}

/*
The expression inside the if( ... ) is the test. 
This uses the identity operator (as described above) to compare the variable iceCream with the string chocolate to see if the two are equal. 
If this comparison returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code—after the else statement—runs instead.
